# train-scheduler


Train Schedule app


The purpose of this application is to use Firebase to store information about a train schedule in a persistent manner. Moment.js is responsible for keeping track of the timing of the train schedule. 

I also added a clock to the top of the page because a schedule is a little silly without the current time.

Mobile functionality would be especially useful in this case and would be something I'd like to add in the future.
