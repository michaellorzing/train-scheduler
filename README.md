# train-scheduler


Train Schedule app


The purpose of this application is to use Firebase to store information about a train schedule in a persistent manner. Moment.js is responsible for keeping track of the timing of the train schedule. 

I also added a clock to the top of the page for better user functionality. I set the page to refresh every 30 seconds to keep the train times consistently in front of the clock time.

Mobile functionality would be especially useful in this case and would be something I'd like to add in the future.
